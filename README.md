# Pre-Bond-TSV-s-Defects
Three-dimensional Integrated Circuits (3D ICs) based on Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs) provide many benefits, such as high
density, high bandwidth and low-power consumption. However, defects in TSV due to complex fabrication steps decrease
the yield and reliability of 3D ICs. Therefore each die should be tested before it is stacked through pre-bond test. Pre-bond
test and defect identification of TSVs are extremely important to screen out defective TSVs early in the manufacturing flow.
Also, test cost minimization is one of the key issues of the testing process. The existing test time minimization solutions for
pre-bond test consider random TSV defects. However, in practice clustered TSV faults are quite common. Here we
propose a novel test time minimization technique to address both random and clustered defect distributions.
Simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve more than 20% reduction in test time for
a 20-TSV network with four faulty TSVs compared to serial testing approach. The proposed algorithm also pinpoints the
defective TSVs in a TSV network with a reduced test time compared to prior works.
